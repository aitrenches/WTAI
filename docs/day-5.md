# Day 5: Implementation, Governance, and Compliance

Welcome to Day 5. Today, we get practical about implementation. We will cover how to prioritize your data and AI portfolio, establish robust governance and compliance frameworks—with a specific focus on Nigeria's NDPA 2023—and create a tangible platform roadmap. The day culminates in a workshop where you will transform your pilot idea from Day 4 into a concrete implementation plan.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of today, you will be able to:

- **Prioritize** a pilot portfolio using ROI and risk scoring methods.
- **Define** a minimal viable control set for AI and data governance, including a clear ownership model.
- **Establish** data SLOs/SLIs, lineage, and observability practices to ensure reliability.
- **Integrate** Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023 obligations directly into your delivery lifecycle.
