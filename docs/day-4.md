# Day 4: From Strategy to Operating Model

Welcome to Day 4. Today, we bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution. We will focus on how to identify high-value opportunities for data and AI, select the right architectural patterns to deliver on them, and establish an operating model that treats data as a core business product. Each session is designed to be interactive, culminating in a workshop where you will design a 90-day pilot project.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of today, you will be able to:

- **Align** AI and data investments to specific business KPI trees (e.g., uptime, OPEX, safety).
- **Select** a baseline architecture with clear non-functional requirements like latency, SLOs, and cost.
- **Draft** a data product definition and its corresponding data contract.
- **Define** evaluation criteria and control points for AI-driven workflows, including human-in-the-loop systems.
